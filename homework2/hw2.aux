In other words, Alice works as a grader for section 1 ($S_1$), and Bob works as a grader for section 2 ($S_2$). At the end of the semester, final grades will be assigned to students in the class based on their final total points. Assume there are two possible grades $A$ and $B$, and Alice and Bob know the final total points for every student in their own sections (Alice does not know the final total points of students in $S_2$, and vice versa).}{1}}
